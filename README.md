# BlazorTabControlVideo
This is an extension of David Eggenberger's work to get TabPanels to work how I wanted.  It has not been ported to MudBlazor.

David's excellent work is here: https://github.com/DavidEggenberger/DavidSeesSharp-Videos/tree/main

I'm only posting so some people can figure out what I did from here: https://github.com/MudBlazor/MudBlazor/issues/7010
